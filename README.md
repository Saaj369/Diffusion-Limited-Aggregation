# Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation
This project explores DFA and fractal analysis using langevin dynamics simulation. The project was done by my group which consisted of my friend Hridhay and me,  as part of final project for course "Computational Physics." 

This project demonstrates **Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)** of particles using **Langevin Dynamics**. It simulates how particles performing Brownian motion aggregate over time to form complex fractal-like structures. The model incorporates realistic thermal noise and damping using the underdamped Langevin equation.
